Though election prediction markets have been being conducted for almost twenty years, to date nearly all of the evidence on efficiency compares election eve forecasts with final pre-election polls and actual outcomes. Here, we present evidence that prediction markets outperform polls for longer horizons. We gather national polls for the 1988 through 2004 U.S. Presidential elections and ask whether either the poll or a contemporaneous Iowa Electronic Markets vote-share market prediction is closer to the eventual outcome for the two-major-party vote split. We compare market predictions to 964 polls over the five Presidential elections since 1988. The market is closer to the eventual outcome 74\% of the time. Further, the market significantly outperforms the polls in every election when forecasting more than 100 days in advance.},

Prediction market based analyses of all presidential elections since 1880 also reveal a similar pattern of partisan impacts, suggesting that electing a Republican president raises equity valuations by 2–3 percent, and that since Ronald Reagan, Republican presidents have tended to raise bond yields.},

Beyond these specific sufficient conditions, we show that for a broad class of models prediction market prices are usually close to the mean beliefs of traders. The key parameters driving trading behavior in prediction markets are the degree of risk aversion and the distribution of beliefs, and we provide some novel data on the distribution of beliefs in a couple of interesting contexts. We find that prediction markets prices typically provide useful (albeit sometimes biased) estimates of average beliefs about the probability an event occurs.},

This paper challenges that optimistic assessment of election markets, based on an analysis of Iowa Electronic Market (IEM) data from presidential elections between 1988 and 2004. We argue that it is inappropriate to naively compare market forecasts of an election outcome with exact poll results on the day prices are recorded, that is, market prices reflect forecasts of what will happen on Election Day whereas trial-heat polls register preferences on the day of the poll. We then show that when poll leads are properly discounted, poll-based forecasts outperform vote-share market prices. Moreover, we show that win projections based on the polls dominate prices from winner-take-all markets. Traders in these markets generally see more uncertainty ahead in the campaign than the polling numbers warrant—in effect, they overestimate the role of election campaigns. Reasons for the performance of the IEM election markets are considered in concluding sections.},

Thus, the collective prices (probabilities) of all related outcomes (whether in a condition or market) should be \$1, representing a combined probability of 1 of any outcome. Despite this design, Polymarket exhibits cases where dependent assets are mispriced, allowing for purchasing (or selling) a certain outcome for less than (or more than) \$1, guaranteeing profit.

Most studies of prediction markets outside the lab are from public markets with large trading populations.

We examine data from prediction markets run by Google, Ford Motor Company, and an anonymous basic materials conglomerate (Firm X). Despite theoretically adverse conditions, we find these markets are relatively efficient, and improve upon the forecasts of experts at all three firms by as much as a 25\% reduction in mean-squared error. The most notable inefficiency is an optimism bias in the markets at Google. The inefficiencies that do exist generally become smaller over time. More experienced traders and those with higher past performance trade against the identified inefficiencies, suggesting that the markets' efficiency improves because traders gain experience and less skilled traders exit the market.},

	abstract = {We analyze financial market data in order to produce an ex-ante assessment of the economic consequences of war with Iraq. The novel feature of our analysis derives from the existence of a market for  Saddam Securities,' a new future traded on an online betting exchange that pays only if Saddam Hussein is ousted. A variety of tests suggest that this future's price provides a plausible estimate of the probability of war. The spot oil price has moved closely with the Saddam Security, suggesting that war raises oil prices by around \$10 per barrel. Futures prices imply that markets expect these large immediate disruptions to dissipate quickly, with prices returning to pre-war levels within about a year and a half. Evidence on the long-run effects is fragile, and while prices are probably expected to fall a little as a result of war, any  oil dividend' will be minimal. We find large effects in equity markets: and war lowers the value of U.S. equities by around 15 percent. This effect is concentrated in the consumer discretionary sector, airlines and IT; the prospect of war bolsters the gold and energy sectors. Analyzing option prices, we find that the large estimated average effects of war reflect the market pricing in a range of different scenarios - a 70 percent probability that it will lead to market declines of 0 to 15 percent, a 20 percent chance of 15 to 30 percent declines, and a 10 percent risk of a fall in excess of 30 percent. Across countries, the most extreme effects are on the stock markets of Turkey, Israel, and several European nations. Countries that are highly enmeshed in the world economy, or net oil importers, are most likely to experience adverse effects from war.},

	abstract = {Political elections are one of the most significant aspects of what constitutes the fabric of the United States. In recent history, typical polling estimates have largely lacked precision in predicting election outcomes, which has not only caused uncertainty for American voters, but has also impacted campaign strategies, spending, and fundraising efforts. One intriguing aspect of traditional polling is the types of questions that are asked -- the questions largely focus on asking individuals who they intend to vote for. However, they don't always probe who voters think will win -- regardless of who they want to win. In contrast, online betting markets allow individuals to wager money on who they expect to win, which may capture who individuals think will win in an especially salient manner. The current study used both descriptive and predictive analytics to determine whether data from Polymarket, the world's largest online betting market, provided insights that differed from traditional presidential polling. Overall, findings suggest that Polymarket was superior to polling in predicting the outcome of the 2024 presidential election, particularly in swing states. Results are in alignment with research on ''Wisdom of Crowds'' theory, which suggests a large group of people are often accurate in predicting outcomes, even if they are not necessarily experts or closely aligned with the issue at hand. Overall, our results suggest that betting markets, such as Polymarket, could be employed to predict presidential elections and/or other real-world events. However, future investigations are needed to fully unpack and understand the current study's intriguing results, including alignment with Wisdom of Crowds theory and portability to other events.},

	abstract = {The emergence of prediction markets during the last election cycle offer a new promise: to better understand the relation between financial markets and political candidates. In this study, we construct of a pair of systematic portfolios designed to perform well, regardless of which candidate wins. We first identify key event windows during which the betting odds changed significantly, thus identifying Harris (H) or Trump (T) favorable periods. Second, we select assets which exceed a performance threshold during H (or T) favorable periods, while ensuring returns remain above a specified floor during unfavorable H (or T) events. Post-election results demonstrate that the combined performance of the asymmetric portfolios significantly outperformed the benchmark, indicating the presence of election-driven arbitrage opportunities.},
