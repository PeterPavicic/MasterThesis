This master thesis asks whether a modern prediction market, Polymarket, or a traditional futures market reflects new information about upcoming Federal Open Market Committee decisions first. Prices are converted to risk-neutral implied probabilities aligned around meeting windows, and VECM-based Granger and instantaneous causality tools are used to evaluate lead-lag and contemporaneous cross-source effects. The core finding is two-way price discovery. Neither leads the other consistently, indicating complementary information aggregation. Results are robust to coarser (five-minute) sampling and weekend effects. The analysis contributes to a growing literature on modern prediction markets in an unprecedented context of a topic.
