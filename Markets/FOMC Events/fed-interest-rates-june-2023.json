      "description": "The FED interest rates are defined in this market by the upper bound of the target federal funds range. The decisions on the target federal fund range are made by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings.\n\nThe resolution source for this market is the FOMC\u2019s statement after its meeting scheduled for June 13-14, 2023 according to the official calendar: https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.\n\nThis market will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d if following the Federal Reserve's June 2023 meeting the upper bound of the target federal funds rate is increased exactly 50 basis points over the level it was prior to the meeting. Otherwise, it will resolve to \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nThe level and change of the target federal funds rate is also published at the official website of the Federal Reserve at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/openmarket.htm.\n\nThis market may resolve as soon as the FOMC\u2019s statement for their June meeting with relevant data is issued. If no statement is released by June 30, 2023, 11:59:59 PM ET, this market will resolve 50-50.",
