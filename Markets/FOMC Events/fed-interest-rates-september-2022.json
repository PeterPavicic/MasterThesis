      "description": "The FED interest rates are defined in this market by the upper bound of the target federal funds range. The decisions on the target federal fund range are made by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings. The resolution source for this market is the FOMC\u2019s statement after the meeting scheduled for September 20-21 according to the official calendar: https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm. After the July 2022 meeting, the upper bound of the federal funds rate was set to 2.50%.\n\nThis market will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d if the upper bound of the target federal funds rate is set to exactly 3.00% (an increase of 50 basis points from the previous level) following the Federal Reserve's September 2022 meeting. Otherwise, it will resolve to \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nThe level and change of the target federal funds rate is also published at the official website of the Federal Reserve at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/openmarket.htm.\n\nThis market resolves as soon as the FOMC\u2019s statement for their September meeting with relevant data is issued.\n\nIf no statement is released by September 28, 2022, 11:59:59 PM ET, this market will resolve 50-50.",
